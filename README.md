# CI/CD from scratch

## Summary

At ironSource infrastructure team, we are responsible for developing an automation framework to help test our various products.

Deploying hundreads of microservices across different platforms, cloud providers and on-prem solutions can become a cumbersome
task. To alleviate the effort of supporting a growing, auto scalable architecture, we had to develop a flexible CI/CD process. One that is easily reused and one that its building blocks are easily replaced. 

This tutorial will walk you through all the steps we use to create our CI/CD infrastructure using docker, jenkins, ansible and more.
